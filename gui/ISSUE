[1] About error message of parameteres in controller.py

  Error message shows when `Distance Measure` is checked with any of the parameters invalid.
However, if the user corrects the parameter but unchecks `Distance Measure`,
GuiController._check_inputs_validity() will not be called and so error message won't be cleared.
Is this what we want?
