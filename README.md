# Webcam Application

Thanks to the contributors of libraries, we try to make all applications require \
only 1 camera, which is the webcam.

## Settings

1. Put a front-face picture of yours named **ref_img.jpg** in folder **img**.
1. Run **main.py**, which is the GUI, you'll see more settings in the settings page.

## main

Contains the applications developed in this repository. \
Using a friendly *Graphical User Interface* instead of Command Line Interface.

Note that there are 2 kinds of model: default and custom, the latter can be \
trained by the user while the former can't. The reason why we do not provide it \
is because of the large file size it has.
