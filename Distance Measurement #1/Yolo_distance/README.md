- Here we are targeting the person and cell phone classes only, for demo purpose.

- you can follow all the steps mentioned in the video to create for other objects as well.

implementation detail available on [_**Darknet**_](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)

## TO DO

- [x] Run Yolo V4 with opencv, making thing easy and simple as possible

- [x] Finding distance of mutiple object at same time.

- [ ] testing, accuracy and error rate

## Installation you need opencv-contrib-python

[opencv contrib](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/)

--> **windows**

`pip install opencv-contrib-python`

--> **Linux or Mac**

`pip3 install opencv-contrib-python`

then just clone this repository and you are good to go.

I have use tiny weights, check out more on darknet github for more
