# Webcam Application

Thanks to the contributors of libraries, we try to make all applications require \
only 1 camera, which is the webcam.

## Settings

Put a front-face picture of yours named **ref_img.jpg** in folder **img** \
and set the parameters in **parameters.txt**.

## Demo

Command `python demo.py` to have a quick veiw on what we can do! \
It's the visualized version that shows the detection result and has no warnings.

## Applications

Command `python real.py` to see what we want to bring in practice. \
All detections proccess in the background. Warnings pop when conditions meet.

## Topics
